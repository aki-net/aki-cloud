# Redirect Options Explained

## What are "Preserve Path" and "Preserve Query"?

When you set up a redirect from one domain to another, you have control over what happens to different parts of the URL. Here's a simple explanation:

### URL Structure
A typical URL has these parts:
```
https://example.com/blog/article?utm_source=google&id=123#section
        ‚Üë           ‚Üë              ‚Üë                      ‚Üë
     Domain       Path         Query Parameters      Fragment
```

## üóÇÔ∏è Preserve Path Option

**What it does:** Controls whether the path (everything after the domain) is kept or removed during redirect.

### When ENABLED (‚úì):
```
User visits:  oldsite.com/blog/my-article
Redirects to: newsite.com/blog/my-article
              ‚Üë The path "/blog/my-article" is preserved
```

**Use this when:**
- Your new site has the same structure as the old one
- You want to redirect users to the exact same page on the new domain
- You're moving to a new domain but keeping all your URLs the same

### When DISABLED (‚úó):
```
User visits:  oldsite.com/blog/my-article
Redirects to: newsite.com
              ‚Üë User lands on homepage, path is removed
```

**Use this when:**
- Your new site has a different structure
- You want all traffic to go to your homepage
- The old paths don't exist on the new site

## üîç Preserve Query Parameters Option

**What it does:** Controls whether URL parameters (the stuff after `?`) are kept or removed.

### When ENABLED (‚úì):
```
User visits:  oldsite.com/shop?product_id=123&utm_source=email&campaign=summer
Redirects to: newsite.com/shop?product_id=123&utm_source=email&campaign=summer
              ‚Üë All parameters are preserved
```

**Use this when:**
- You need to track marketing campaigns (utm_source, utm_campaign, etc.)
- Your new site uses the same parameter structure
- You want to maintain analytics tracking
- The target site needs these parameters to function properly

### When DISABLED (‚úó):
```
User visits:  oldsite.com/shop?product_id=123&utm_source=email&campaign=summer
Redirects to: newsite.com/shop
              ‚Üë Clean URL, all parameters removed
```

**Use this when:**
- You want clean URLs on the target site
- The parameters from the old site aren't compatible
- You don't need tracking information
- The target site doesn't use these parameters
